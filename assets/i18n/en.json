This is the best testament to my honest and fair operation, free from any illicit activities. My profit model is solely based on advertising revenue within the application and does not involve any improper or illegal ways of obtaining benefits.\n\nHowever, I also understand that each person has different levels of concern for their privacy.

Please rest assured, this app itself is not necessarily going to result in your Riot account being banned. In fact, other third-party apps installed on your computer, such as Blitz, Valorant Tracker, Discord, and so on, also carry a certain risk of erroneous bans.\n\nThis app does not directly access your game data through your computer but accomplishes corresponding operations by sending Riot's API. The mistaken banning situations could involve many factors, including but not limited to whether you have used internet cafes, whether your computer has installed other cheats or auxiliary programs, among other issues.\n\nI value every user's gaming experience and hope all information can be accurately conveyed. Please ensure the accuracy when sharing information about this app to avoid spreading false rumors, which could inconvenience other users. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.",

We deeply appreciate your understanding."
